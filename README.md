## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we create one of two possible computer games: Word Guess or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
- Psychic Game: 
  - Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.
## Technical Approach
- The challenges to this assignment using an implementing mutiple new concepts at the same time including:
  - Javascript in general
  - DOM Listeners
  - Basic user validation
- A key learning from this exercise was working with arrays, the value of drafting the logic for the game BEFORE coding, and surprisingly, learning from other's exisiting code via Google the concept of generating random numbers between specific vaules -- and linking it to the coresponding Character Code numbers.
- This was essentially a warm-up exercise for the Word Guess Game Challenge - but I was able to use much of the logic from this directly to find the subsequent solution. 
- THis seems simple now but was challenging and fun to make at the tiem - joy!
